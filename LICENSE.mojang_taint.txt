Some versions of the binaries are built using files from Mojang.
There are some notes about this in the MCPConfig docs:
https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MCPConfig/blob/master/Mojang.md

My (mk-pmb's) private, non-lawyer opinion, at 2023-04-23:

As far as I understand those notes, the Mojang license is problematic
for libraries used in mods, but not for the resulting mods themselves.
Thus, EditSign should not be affected.

Additionally, I understand "obfuscation logs" to mean the diagnostic
output of a fully automated process whose purpose is to take parts
of Minecraft code and remove the expressions of artistic choices that
had been in there, with no additional creative input in that process.
I have strong doubts if the result of such a process would even be
protected under EU law, so I might even be entitled to redistribute them.
(Which is moot because, as far as I understand the build process,
I don't distribute them anyway.)

I conclude from Mojangs behavior in the past few years that they intend
to support the Minecraft modding community. They probably intended to
allow the community to build and distribute these mods,
even if the wording of their license is not entirely clear
about some of the edge cases.

However, I'm not a lawyer and I cannot provide legal counsel on this,
so please form your own opinion on whether the Mojang license problem
affects you.
